This code takes the generic map pin and allows you to set a custom  pin color and alphanumeric text on the pin. Rather than generating dozens or hundreds of separate images, this tool generates a single sprite PNG image. By using a sprite image, load performance is optimized when you have multiple pins on your map.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Demo\r\nVisit [http://mapsprites.zineer.com](http://mapsprites.zineer.com) for a demo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-40842321-10","note":"Don't delete this file!
